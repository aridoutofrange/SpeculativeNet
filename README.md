# SpeculativeNet
SpeculativeNet is a Python implementation of a deep neural network architecture for accurate and efficient branch prediction in speculative execution. The network takes as input a sequence of program counter (PC) values, which represent the addresses of branch instructions in the code, and outputs a probability distribution over the possible outcomes of each branch, indicating the likelihood that the branch will be taken or not taken. The network is designed to learn patterns and correlations in branch behavior based on the program context, in order to optimize the performance and security of speculative execution in modern processors.
